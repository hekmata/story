THe next thing I gona to learn is git. It will be intresting.
start wiht git init to start working with git.
After changing in the file, will add the .txt file with git and chack the 
status with command " git status", and then give message that till now 
the change is completed with command line " git commit -m " complete chapter1.txt". befor that you have to init git with command "git init".
you can check the status of git with " git status".
you can see what commit you have made by spealy write code " git log" command.
